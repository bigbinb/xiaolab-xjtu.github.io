      <description>I am a Associate Professor in School of Basic Medical Sciences at Xi’an Jiaotong University. Prior to joining XJTU, I completed my Ph.D. in Xuerui Yang&amp;rsquo;s lab at Tsinghua University, where I studied the gene dysregulations of cancers at both transcriptional and translational levels based on high-throughput sequencing techniques. Then, I worked as a postdoctoral associate in Jason Locasale&amp;rsquo;s Lab at Duke University, studying cancer metabolism and tumor microenvironment at single cell resolution.</description>
